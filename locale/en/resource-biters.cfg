[mod-setting-description]
resource-biters-add-resource-to-drop-table=All resource biters will drop the ore they are made from.
resource-biters-resource-drop-rate=If Resource Drops are enabled, sets the chance a resource is dropped when a biter dies. One is a guaranteed drop.
resource-biters-resource-drop-amount=How much of the resource is dropped when a biter dies. Scales with the health of the biter. For example: setting it to 1 means that a small iron biter will drop 1 iron ore per drop, while a medium will drop 5 iron ore per drop. Drops cap at 25x base drop.
resource-biters-biter-health-multiplier=Modifies the health of each resource biter.
